Since some months ago, the YaST Team at SUSE has been using [Scrum][1]
to organize the work. Among other things, that means the whole team
takes part in a review meeting every three weeks to showcase the fixed
bugs and the implemented features. To support those review meetings we
often create screenshots, text summaries, short videos and other
material. Is it not a pity that all that content get unnoticed for
curious users and potential contributors?

In order to give the SUSE and openSUSE communities an opportunity to
lurk into those review meetings, we have decided to create this team
blog and post here the highlights after every meeting. Not all the fixes
and features will be covered, but we’ll try to blog about the most
exciting or relevant changes.

Obviously, many of those posts will be more exciting for developers and
Tumbleweed users than for users of the stable release (bugfixes tend to
be unexciting). But, as some kind of bonus track, Leap 42.1 users can
always revisit the [summary of what the recent release brought][2] to
the YaST (and friends) world.

The current sprint ends right before Christmas, so stay tuned!
